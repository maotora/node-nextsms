# NextSMS Nodejs Client


The **NextSMS Nodejs Client** allows developers to easily intergrate [NextSMS](https://nextsms.co.tz/) solutions in their Javascript code, and build robust applications and software.


## Documentation

Take a look at the [SDK API docs here](https://nextsms-js.netlify.app/).

## Getting Started

1. **Sign up at [NextSMS Portal](https://nextsms.co.tz/)** â€“ Before you begin, you need to sign up for an account and retrieve your credentials.

   [minimum requirements](https://nextsms-js.netlify.app/docs/requirements.html), including having **Node >= 10.1**.
4. **Install the SDK** â€“ Using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the recommended way to install the
   Pesa SDK for JS. The SDK is available via [NPM] under the
   [`@nextsms/nextsms-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nextsms/nextsms-js) package. You can run the following in the base directory of your project to add the SDK as a dependency:
    ```sh
    npm install @nextsms/nextsms-js
    ```
    Please see the
    [Installation section of the User Guide](https://nextsms-js.netlify.app/docs/installation.html) for more
    detailed information about installing the SDK through Composer and other
    means.
4. **Using the SDK** â€“ The best way to become familiar with how to use the SDK
   is to read the [User Guide](https://nextsms-js.netlify.app/docs/guide.html).
